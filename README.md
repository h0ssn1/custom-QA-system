# Build a Custom Question Answering System tailored to Your Data

Question-answering systems are computer-based systems that are designed to answer questions posed by humans in a helpful and accurate manner. These systems use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand the context and intent behind a question and provide a relevant response.

Question-answering systems can be categorized into two main types: open-domain and closed-domain. Open-domain systems aim to answer any question on any topic, while closed-domain systems focus on a specific domain or topic, such as medicine, law, or history.

Question-answering systems have become increasingly popular in recent years due to advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. They are used in a variety of applications, such as virtual assistants, chatbots, and search engines.

Now I want to tell you how to create your own QA system using the haystack pipeline. In this way, you can inject your data into the model and the model will find the response base on your data. all of these codes are available in haystack documentation but I donâ€™t want you lost in documents:).

for example, you can add your data about what should you do in a week and then feed this data to the model. When you ask a question about your data you will get the answer.
